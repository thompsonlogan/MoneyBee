*****Known Bugs/Design Deficiencies*****
- New Transaction: Upon creation. The maximum amount for an expense/revenue automatically 0's off to avoid out of Int32 bounds (reason for bug: amount entered not intended to be excessively great)
- New Transaction: Attempting to undo after the creation of the above transaction will throw an error (reason for bug: same as listed above)
- Log in: After creating an example of the above transaction, the compiler will throw and error if that same user attempts to re-log (reason for bug: same as listed above)
- New Category: Setting a priority rating is limited to the Int32 limits. Throws error if out of bounds (reason for bug: originally designed with 0-10 scroll rating in mind)
- Money Bee Form (Settings Tab): The tab is almost empty other than a log out button (reason for UI deficiency: orignally designed to have more operations as shown in previous iterations of Money Bee)
- Automatic Transaction: Attempting to edit a transaction that has been generated automatically throws an error (reason for bug: bug found too late in development to resolve by deployment period)
- Delete Categories/Transactions: currently unable to delete unwanted categories and transactions (reason for deficiency: not enough to implement by time of deployment)
- Transaction in Database: Transaction number errors when being saved to database (reason for bug: more knowledge about database work required)
